# Notes

# Breaking Changes** start `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.

# Provide links or keys to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources
# Example: Github issue #23

# To close multiple issues, preface each issue reference with one of the above keywords. You must use the keyword before each issue you reference for the keyword to work.
# For example, This closes #34, closes #23, and closes example_user/example_repo#42 would close issues #34 and #23 in the same repository, and issue #42 in the "example_user/example_repo" repository.

# If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
# In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
